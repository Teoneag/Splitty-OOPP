# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass/Fail

Feedback: Pass

#### Agenda 


Mark: Very good

Feedback: The agenda followed the repository in time and followed the template nicely.  As an improvement you can make it more specific where you plan for the next sprint and where you review last week's work, the agenda was mostly focused on the feedback rubrics (as there was plenty to talk about).


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes have been added into the agenda file and they are clear. I would suggest as an improvement to increase the amount of detail.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair did a great job, ensured all topics of the agenda were covered and covered them for an appropriate amount of time. I think as an improvement do not forget to make sure everyone gives their input on certain issues. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting, most persons were active in the meeting and the atmosphere was constructive and positive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You seem on a good track to have a working application until the project end. Plenty of your features are working nicely. I think if you manage to finish the basic requirements after this sprint you will be on a great path. Keep in mind week 8 and 9 will be the most stressful regarding the code if you plan to finish everything. Lastly, make sure to follow the rubrics for certain specific stuff as websockets or testing dependent on components (you can use mockito for that if you do not like the stubs system that is provided in the example code).


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark : Very Good

Feedback: Everyone seems to be contributing equally.
