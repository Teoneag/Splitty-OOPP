# Meeting Week 4 Team 15


#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Pass

Feedback: There has been a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added in the repository in time, and it follows the template. It is concise and clear but,  I think an improvement would be to not have the bullet point "Agenda"  since it diminishes the contents in it. Having just the sub-tasks under agenda be bigger tasks would make it better.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes have been merged into the agenda file and there is a good amount. They are clear and contain assigned people to tasks.


#### Chair performance


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: I think the chair did a good performance, he ensured the agenda topics were covered, and they were covered for (roughly) the appropriate amount of time. He also managed to keep the flow of the discussion and to follow with topics which was good. I think an improvement would be to try to get people's noses out of their laptops and poke them if they zone out or focus on something instead of paying attention to the topic at hand.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting and I think everyone was active and the atmosphere was super constructive. Overall great discussion and it seems you are communicating decently. Everyone's ideas were listened to. As an improvement I would say try to not bother with working on laptops throughout the meeting and always give your input to decisions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You seem on a great path regarding your product, you already have the two components connected and have working functionality which is great. There has been tremendous progress from last week. It would be great to have a small demo of all the functionalities you implement in week 6, but you already (kind of) presented a demo so just do that again, maybe a bit more organised.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Everyone seems to contribute equally.
