# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There has been a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: I like the agenda, it is simple and concise, but it does have some good questions in the sub-tasks that can be leveraged by the chair to bring up discussion points which I really like. The points are clear. 
My only suggestion would be to maybe make the presentation of the current up more like a presentation of the past week progress and to make it longer than 1 minute :) 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes seem to contain the agenda topics and there is a good amount of them. They present decisions made / assigned tasks and also people assigned to the tasks (like the chair next week and minute taker).


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The chair did a great job at presenting the topics of the agenda. I think the chair kept a nice flow of the discussion and covered the topics in a somewhat appropriate amount of time. Obviously sometimes things might take a bit longer but overall it was fine. 
One thing I can suggest as an improvement is to maybe try to directly poke participants on their feedback and not just ask generally what their opinion is as some people might not answer, and it's important to have their opinion.
But overall honestly not much to complain about from my part. Great job !!


#### Attitude & Relation


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting, you were active and involved in the discussion. The atmosphere was really constructive and collaborative. I think everyone's ideas were listened to and taken into account. 
My only suggestion is even if you are doing something like taking notes or checking a requirement / something on the computer to still be paying attention and to be giving your input on the discussion topics. But overall good atmosphere and nice discussion and planning.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented nicely the state of the application and merged the changes to main. There has been good progress since last week and you seem on a good track. 
As a suggestion I would say to present maybe verbally what has been changed from last week as in first weeks of implementation you won't have to complex features and maybe present the features on computers when they work both front-end and back-end, so they are more satisfying ;) .


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Everyone seems to be contributing equally to the team.
