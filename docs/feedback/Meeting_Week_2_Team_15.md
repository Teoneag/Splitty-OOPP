# Meeting Team 15 Week 2


#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added in time. It did follow the template. I like the add of sub-points, but I think you should try to make them a bit longer and clearer. Also, I do not think the format with <Agenda something> is needed, it clutters things up, but if it looks nicer for your text editor sure.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: About that ... no minute taker last time.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: I think the chair did a decent job at covering the agenda topics, but I think it is their responsibility to make sure the meeting does not diverge too much which happened at the start with the template project setup and later on. Ideally you should try to see if there is an issue and then cover it after the meeting with your colleagues. (more about this in attitude / relation) I think the topics were not covered for an appropriate amount of time. After the template project the agenda was not exactly followed in terms of time. When it comes to writing agenda please try to write it based on how you imagine the team meeting to go. And after that try to follow it. The template is just a guideline, and you should adapt to your meetings. 
I think the chairman did a good job at keeping the discussion going. A last suggestion would be to try to integrate the participants who are not too active. It is their responsibility to try to be active, but you can also help them by for example asking them directly for input on the situation. Having a good meeting is about collaboration from both chairman and team.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting. Most people were involved in the discussion, but I would suggest everyone to bring activity and to give their input on certain topics. Some participants not always give their input. The atmosphere was constructive, but I think at times the discussion deviated quite a lot. I think it's good to keep the meetings with TA's as discussions and planning / updating. The actual work should ideally be done outside of these (or outside the agenda) because we will be here for 45 minutes, so you can try to do appropriate planning. It is always good to first plan the week before doing a certain specific task. Lastly, I think everyone was listened to, but as I have said, everyone has to try to be involved!

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: This is as an incentive to start writing code. You should have already started doing some planning on what / how to code certain parts and ideally write issues. 
I can suggest a workflow similar to : issue -> branch -> when done merge request -> closes branch and issue. You can also try to have a meeting to discuss and have a common idea of how the application should work.
Reminder that you need this week all to have code contribution (the knock-out criteria starts this week !. One merge request ideally close to 100+ lines of code 1 merge review.).
If you happen to miss it, it is not that bad, but you will have to do 2x the work next week to catch up. I would suggest not failing behind and trying to be consistent with code contribution. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: I think everyone contributed to the planning for this week.
