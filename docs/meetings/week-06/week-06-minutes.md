## **TA announcements**
- merge MR request before the week ends, so it counts automatically to that week without needing a TA to check it manually

## **Showing Ta application**
-   Ta liked the progress :))

## **Extensions**
- we already have almost all the basic requirements
  - backlog: sum of extensions (we have to add this)
- we have 3 weeks of coding left
  - we have to start working on extensions
- implementation rubric
  - all the features have a degree of how good they are implemented
  - check this for the basic requirements before starting on extensions
  - check edge cases: some titles for event can break it
    - errors


## **Assignments**
### **Technology assignment**
- user more gitlab features
- less small issues (compound them into bigger issues)
- close milestones
- time tracking (well on estimating time)
    - use it more
- nested feature branches
    - when we have bigger issues, with 2 participants working on it, we can use nested feature branches
    = 2 branches on the same feature, first merge them into a feature branch, then merge that into the main branch
    - we have to do this more

### **Buddy check**
- tip from the TA: give examples when talking about improvements (none of the teams did this)
  - follow the model (hard requirement) + be detailed

### **Code Contributions and Code Reviews Assignment**
- isolation & build server: excellent
- TA summary
  - commits that were tiny (they cluttered up the repository)
  - review
    - we have description in some MRs but need to be more detailed
    - it's not good to have 8 issues solved by an MR
    - comments should be more challenging, more like a conversation (spam comments from WP on GitLab)
  - isolation: good
  - technology: later today
    - we've implemented most of it
    - we missed some stuff to get to excellent
    - discuss tomorrow dependency injection
      - use services
        - controller separate from the service
        - call repository from service
  - frameworks for web sockets - to be discussed tomorrow
  - jackson
    - should be implicit

### **HCI**
- main priority
- it's formative
- points
  - color contrast
  - keyboard shortcuts
  - icons
  - how the application looks, moves, pages connect to each other
  - codding stops on week 9
    - tell the TA specifics about the presentation (week 10)
- is path or fail

### **Questions for TA**
- file path - solved before 
- testing
  - use stubs for testing
    - library mockito
    - testing rubric for next week
