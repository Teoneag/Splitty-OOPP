# Weekly TA Meeting




## TA Announcements
The tool used to check lines of code has a broad overview. So there shouldn't be any need to worry.

## Updates on Action Points
- Try to have a more full stack approach
    - one participant does one 'thing' but does the front and back end for that one 'thing'
    - Good for the presentation so that you know about everything


## Agenda


### Scrum

- Backlog points are big features
- For scrum we want to split up features into smaller bits and work on those
- These bits will be issues that we work on
- Tag use:
    - TODO - when you want something to be done
    - Pending, waiting for someone to finish their task
    - In progress - currently being worked on
    - Done - When the task has been done


### Issue Board
- Using the scrum style for the issue boards
- Can you additional labels if necessary or wanted


### Merging
- GitLab has cool feature about blocking issues
- Merge more often 
    - Wait for 2 people to approve (if you are the 2nd participant just merge)
    - Merge when you are ready - don't wait for the meeting
    - Keep the merge meetings but will be used to discuss rather than merge everything


### Weekly Planning
- Split the tasks beforehand
- Use issue board to make new tasks every meeting - divide the tasks then do them
- Have some extra issues so that they can be completed if someone is done with their weekly task
- additional issues can be created individually but make it clear what someone has to do
    - Avoids the need for entire meetings to create issues
    - Make sure to add more extensive descriptions for the merge requests

TA Notes regarding Epics
- Could have milestones based on sprints
- Make sure approaching extensions one by one


### Time planning

When do we want to have what done?

- Basic requirements: 
    - Current estimate/goal: 2-3 weeks from now
    - make an overview of what is remaining to allow for a more precise estimate

    


### Code of Conduct
- Everyone is done with their section
- Code of Conduct is not graded (goes into self-reflection which is graded)



## Questions for TA

- Hibernate template
    - Supposed to use it
    - Template seems to have a lot of the necessary things that we need for the project
- build.gradle
    - We are allowed to edit it
- Branch naming
    - Create branch from issue (allows for consistency)
- Code Structure
    - Middleware
    - Search up what DTO is and use something like that
    - Commons class is the same for frontend and back end

<br>

- TA Suggestions
    - Can use figma to make some diagrams
    - Scene builder is only good for the basics
        - for more advanced: will need to edit the files
    - Need pages
        - front-end pages are needed so the function can be made
    - Try to do some tests
        - Front-end is difficult to test



## Off - Topic Notes

Starting to do full-stack asap is a good idea. We can discuss and check on Wednesday 




The 100+ lines, etc. counts during the midterm week!

Use double points on the tag to make them related
