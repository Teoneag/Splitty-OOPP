## **TA announcements**
- Before starting to work on the presentations:
  - Go through all the summative requirements 
  - Work on gitlab stuff to get all of that sorted for a good grade
- Make sure to do the teamwork reflection (2200-2700 words!!!)


## **Showing the app**
- It looks better than last week (for normal people)
- Some good technical improvements:
  - Long polling is working
  - Currency is supposed to work...
  - Language switch
  - Debts added today
  

## **Basic requirements**
- These are pretty much done
- These are pass fail, so we do not need excelent
  - But testing these features is important

## **Extensions**
- Live language switch: 
  - The flag does not work
  - We can use a list of all the flags (a pack)
  - See only the flag instead of the text?
- Currency:
  - One-line problem fixed during meeting 
  - Some problems with websockets still, but easily fixable as only the exchange rates are sent to the client.
- Open debts:
  - Needs to have the currency system implemented here
- We need to check what we have and decide what we want to improve
- We should decide on whether we want to do the email extension?

## **Teamwork self-reflection**
- Similar to buddy check
- We need to write 2200-2700 words
- Assignment is on brightspace
- Due friday (Formative)

## **Project pitch**
- We got a 7.3 for the project pitch
- We need a Demonstration. Options:
  - To pre-record all of it
  - To pre-record it without sound and talk over it
  - We can do it completely live
  
## **Additional points to work on**
- Focus on improving and finishing what we have
- Create more contrast
  - We can have multiple themes
  - Possibly we can create a dark mode

- Testing!!!
  - Front-end is not required but can be useful
  - Use test stubs

- We need more services
- Services before testing
  - 700+ lines for eventoverviewctrl...
  - Serverutils to services
- We should not add random issues just to add issues
  - We should go back to using milestones
  
## **Tomorrow**
- Lay out what we still need to do for the next two weeks
- Make a plan for this week
- (possibly) Re-adjust the priorities
